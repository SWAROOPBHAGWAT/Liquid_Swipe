# Liquid_Swipe

Liquid Swipe is a Flutter package that provides a smooth and customizable page transition effect for creating beautiful onboarding screens, walkthroughs, or any other sliding UI elements in your Flutter applications. It allows you to create swipeable pages with fluid animations, making your app's user interface more engaging and interactive.

Key features of Liquid Swipe:

Smooth Page Transitions: Liquid Swipe offers smooth and fluid page transitions that mimic the behavior of liquid or water-like movements. This adds a visually appealing touch to your app's UI.

Customizable Wave Effects: You can customize the wave effects applied during the swipe transition. The package provides options like liquid reveal, circular reveal, and more, allowing you to tailor the animation to suit your app's design.

Multiple Page Support: Liquid Swipe supports multiple pages, making it suitable for creating onboarding screens, tutorials, slideshows, image galleries, and other swipeable UI components with multiple content sections.

Configurable Transition Values: You can configure transition values such as the full transition distance, wave type, enable loop for continuous swiping, and more to control the behavior of the swipe animation.

Interactive Callbacks: The package provides callback functions like onPageChangeCallback and currentUpdateTypeCallback that allow you to respond to user interactions during the swipe, enabling you to implement custom logic or update UI elements based on the swipe progress.
